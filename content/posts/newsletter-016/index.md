Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [ggez]

![ggez bunnymark - 60,000 buns at 60 FPS](ggez-bun.png)

[ggez] is a 2D game framework inspired by Love2D.  We're chugging
along getting everything prepared for a 0.6 release at the end of 2020,
and a lot of work has been done in the last month:

- All major dependencies have been updated, including a long-overdue
  update to `winit` 0.23
- Over a dozen pull requests have been merged, large and small
- A bunch of old issues have been cleaned up

Major features to look forward to include far better math performance, a
`MeshBatch` type, better ergonomics on Linux Wayland, and more.  There's
lots of work still to be done though.  A bunch of issues are out of date
and need triage, docs need to be proofread, and especially examples need
be updated and tested on every platform imaginable.  Try out the `devel`
branch and give it a go!
